# MIPS Processor in VHDL

A university project focused on the design and implementation of a simplified **single-cycle MIPS processor** using **VHDL** and simulated through **ModelSim**.

The project follows a **Harvard Architecture** approach, utilizing separate instruction and data memories, and demonstrates the fundamental operation of a CPU datapath, control logic, and arithmetic execution pipeline.

---

## Overview

This project implements a simplified MIPS CPU capable of executing a subset of MIPS instructions through a single-cycle architecture.

The processor was developed modularly, with each hardware component implemented as an independent VHDL module and verified using dedicated testbenches.

The goal of the project was to understand:

- CPU datapath design
- Control unit implementation
- Register operations
- ALU functionality
- Memory access
- Branching logic
- Hardware simulation and testing using ModelSim

## Supported Instructions

| Instruction | Description |
|---|---|
| `add` | Register addition |
| `addi` | Immediate addition |
| `sw` | Store word |
| `beq` | Branch if equal |
| `bne` | Branch if not equal |

---

## Architecture

The CPU is implemented as a:

- **Single-Cycle Processor**
- **Harvard Architecture**
  - Separate Instruction Memory
  - Separate Data Memory

Every instruction completes execution in a single clock cycle.

## Testing & Simulation

Each major hardware module includes its own dedicated testbench for verification.

Testing was performed using:

- **ModelSim**
- VHDL simulations
- Waveform analysis

The final integrated processor was tested through the top-level `MIPS.vhd` module.
